This is another programming exercise for CrowdStreet involving generating a list of numbers.

The solution invovles generating a list with the correct distribution and
shuffling the resulting list, using a slightly modified shuffle algorithm to
prevent repeating numbers.

I didn't use any Java IDE or tools, To run and test I:

```
cd src
javac *.java
java CrowdStreet
```

This was more because I don't frequently use java, and I didn't feel like
spending time setting up tools.
